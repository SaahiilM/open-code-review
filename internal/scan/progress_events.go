// dashboard renders as rows and counters.
//
// A scan's unit of work is a single file, so its key is simply the path —
// there is no grouping step to derive a composite key from.

// publishPlanned reports the run's coverage denominator, published once
// selection has settled so the dashboard's bar starts at a real total.

// Package progress is the single sink for everything a run wants to tell the
// user while it is still working. The review pipeline used to call
// fmt.Fprintf(stdout.Writer(), "[ocr] ...") at every interesting moment, which
// produced a wall of lines nobody could read at a glance and no answer to
// "which file is it on right now".
//
// Events published here reach one of two consumers. The default text sink
// prints each event as the [ocr] line it always was, so piped, CI, and
// --format json/sarif runs are byte-for-byte unchanged. When a human is
// watching an interactive terminal, a Bubble Tea program consumes the same
// events and draws a live dashboard instead.
//
// Preserving the text output is a contract, not an accident: an event that
// exists only to update the dashboard (a group starting, a round beginning)
// must carry no Text, because the pipeline already prints its own line for
// that fact at the call site. Publishing both would add a duplicate line to
// every non-interactive run.
//
// The pipeline publishes from many goroutines at once, so every entry point is
// safe for concurrent use. The zero value is usable and discards.

// This file publishes the structured half of a review run's progress. The
// plain [ocr] lines the pipeline has always printed are emitted separately, at
// the point where the fact becomes known; these functions publish the same
// facts in a shape a live dashboard can render as rows and counters.
//
// The key is always fileGroupKey, never FileGroup.Label: Label is free-form
// text an LLM produced, while the key is derived from the paths and is the
// same string the tool loop reports tool calls under. Keying the dashboard on
// it is what lets a `▶ file_read` line be attributed to the row that caused
// it.

// publishPlanned reports the run's coverage denominator. It is published once
// selection has settled, before any dispatch, so the dashboard's bar starts at
// a real total rather than growing out of an unknown one.
